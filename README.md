This repository displays and lays out my project that I have worked on during my time at Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. 
The .zip file is the template for the Azure resource group that I have engineered,for the pupose of having a functional database for NFL Players and injuries.
The word document further details the purpose and development of the project, and how the idea is put to use to enhance a project that Microsoft already has in place, and further expand upon its capabilities by incorporating Azure.
